### B√°rbara Flores

The objective of this project is to generate a linear regression model that allows setting prices for Airbnb ads in Asheville, North Carolina.

For more details on the assigned task, it can be found on the [website](https://anlane611.github.io/ids702-fall23/DAA/DA1.html) developed by professor Andrea Lane for the Modeling and Representation of Data class (IDS 702) at Duke University.

**Dataset**

We have a database of various Airbnb rental listings in the city, obtained through web scraping. The original database includes 75 variables. This dataset was extracted in June 2023 by the company Inside Airbnb and contains information about 3,239 rental listings in Asheville, North Carolina. Thus, the conclusions are based on this time period. The database and dictionary can be downloaded from [listings.csv](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/listings.csv) and [Airbnb 0Data Dictionary](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/Inside%20Airbnb%20Data%20Dictionary.xlsx) file respectively

The code was developed using the R programming language and is stored in the [AirbnbPricing.qmd](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/AirbnbPricing.qmd) file 

The final deliverable report for this analysis can be found in the file: [AirbnbPricing.pdf](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/AirbnbPricing.pdf)
