# Airbnb Price Regression Modeling
### BÃ¡rbara Flores

The objective of this project is to generate a linear regression model that allows setting prices for Airbnb ads in Asheville, North Carolina.

For more details on the assigned task, they can be found on the [website](https://anlane611.github.io/ids702-fall23/DAA/DA1.html) developed by Andrea Lane for the Modeling and Representation of Data class (IDS 702) at Duke University.

**Dataset**
We have a database of various Airbnb rental listings in the city, obtained through web scraping, which contains detailed information about the listing. The original database includes 75 variables. This dataset was extracted in June 2023 by the company Inside Airbnb and contains information about 3,239 rental listings in Asheville, North Carolina. Therefore, the conclusions drawn are based on this time period. The database and dictionary can be downloaded from [listings.csv](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/listings.csv) and [Inside Airbnb Data Dictionary]((http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/))

The code was developed using the R programming language and is stored in the [AirbnbPricing.qmd](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/AirbnbPricing.qmd) file
