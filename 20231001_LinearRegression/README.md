# Airbnb Price Regression Modeling
### BÃ¡rbara Flores


In this project, I built a regression model to predict rental prices in Asheville, NC. 

The [database](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/listings.csv) utilized is obtained through web scraping carried out by  [insideairbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

The code was developed using the R programming language and is stored in the [AirbnbPricing.qmd](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS702_ModelingAndRepresentationOfData/blob/main/20231001_LinearRegression/AirbnbPricing.qmd) file
